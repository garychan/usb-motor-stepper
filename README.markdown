# Precise stepper motor control for Linux/Mac/Windows

Connect your computer to an embedded target and control up to 4 stepper
motors.  The embedded target handles the step timing and limit switches
allowing micro second precision control of 4 axis motion.

Command individual steps or linear movement.

Current targets are:

1. [Olimex LPC-P1343](http://www.olimex.com/dev/lpc-p1343.html)
2. Local simulator for testing
